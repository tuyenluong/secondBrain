# Starter Pack

Welcome to Second Brain - Obsidian starter pack!

To utilize all this pack, please download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and learn how to use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) first. 

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) mainly uses `.md` file due to its lightweight attribute and no-mouse mindset for anyone with a high typing rate per minute.

The following is the list of setups that I've added: plugin, hotkeys, template that I have added.
- Templates
  - Added an Index and an example template inside the Templates folder
  - Along with the hotkeys in the Global Hotkeys file

- Kanban board
  - The Kanban card will create a folder to hold Kanban board files and all the notes
  - Already set the directory path for the note that will be placed after it is created by the card
  - Hotkeys to switch between markdown mode and Kanban mode

- Index folder
  - Index files will replace the tag, used to make links for visibility purposes in the graph view
  - Index file combined with a data-view plugin will be excellent in terms of managing and linking notes automatically

## Note that each topic should have its folder and template for tracking purposes.

## Guide
1. Go to "*Global Hotkeys*" file and grasp the basic concept of how to use this note. (*secondBrain > Global Hotkeys*)
2. Each topic you guys want to share must go inside a folder of its own, if it's a series then create a template in the *Templates* folder.
